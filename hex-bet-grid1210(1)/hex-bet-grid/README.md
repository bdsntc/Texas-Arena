# AgentPay

**AgentPay** is a Web3-native AI application that demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can pay for intelligence using the x402 protocol.

Instead of traditional API keys or subscriptions, AgentPay visualizes a future where AI agents independently request paid capabilities, execute on-chain payments, and unlock premium intelligence in real time.

## 🚀 What is AgentPay?

AgentPay is a front-end–first product showcasing **AI autonomous payments**.

Users can:
- Select AI agents
- Assign tasks
- Watch agents trigger `402 Payment Required`
- Observe real-time payment flows
- See how paid capabilities unlock better results

All interactions are visualized clearly to help users, developers, and investors understand how **x402-powered AI payments** work.
